The main two files are Processor.java and MainMemory.java
In Command Line (for me, the IDEA Terminal), cd to this directory and compile the java files using the commands:

javac Processor.java
javac MainMemory.java

From there, run the command java Processor [samplefile.txt] [value for timer]
Example: java Processor sample1.txt 30
